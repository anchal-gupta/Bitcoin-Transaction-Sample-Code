# Bitcoin-Transaction-Sample-Code

## To test a Bitcoin transaction using my code, all you have to do is - 

**STEP 1 -** Download the files - send_dummy.js and package.json
**STEP 2 -** Run npm install
**STEP 3 -** Modify send_dummy.js with your host, username, password, from address, to address, amount, private key.
**STEP 4 -** At terminal, run - "node send_dummy.js", AND there you Go!

Your will see the transaction details at terminal if everything goes correct.


If you face any difficulties in running this code, you can reach out to me directly at my mail ID - "anchalchery@gmail.com", I will be more than happy to help :)
