# Bitcoin-Transaction-Sample-Code

## To test a Bitcoin transaction using my code, all you have to do is - 

**STEP 1 -** Download the files - send_dummy.js and package.json<br><br>
**STEP 2 -** Run npm install<br><br>
**STEP 3 -** Modify send_dummy.js with your host, username, password, from address, to address, amount, private key.<br><br>
    network: 'testnet', //can be mainnet or testnet
		host: '1.111.111.11', //enter your host IP
		port: 18332, //18332 for test
		username: 'bitcoin',  //your host username here
		password: '111111111', //your host password here


**STEP 4 -** At terminal, run - "node send_dummy.js", AND there you Go!<br><br>

Your will see the transaction details at terminal if everything goes correct.<br><br>
